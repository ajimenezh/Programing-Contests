Challenge 16 - ÑAPA

This problem is similar to the classic problem of segments intersection, so we can apply the same technique of a sweep line with a binary Tree. In the B-Tree we store the lowest point of the circle, and for each circle we search each circle intersecting the sweep line between y-r-100 and y+r.
